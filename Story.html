          <h5 class="card-title">What Was The Failure To Me</h5>
          <p class="card-text">I left school when I was in the eighth grade because there were particular problems facing me. I lost hope in myself, but my father was always by my side and would not leave me, so he decided to employ me with him at work as a jewelry designer I knew nothing about jewelry and i was not interested but i gained experience for 1 year and 6months as a matrix designer everything was fine but the problem drew me again so i have no other choices but  to leave the job. I didn't see hope in myself and thought that i would be a loser and i will not succed in my future and precede as i am. I have been in love with computers since I was young, and I liked to dissasemble the device piece by piece and go back collecting it piece by piece I was encouraged and went to an institute I learned to repair computers for one year and earned a degree, but I could not find a job because the situation in Lebanon is difficult. I was so curious to know how the web is made and how works But I did not have the will to learn, and I did not know how to start, and I left myself for one year  without doing anything. In the first month of August 2020, My friend spoke to me and explained how to start learning Web development Unfortunately, when I started to learn, the port of Beirut exploded and completely destroyed my house, but this time I gave up 5 months after the disaster I met my friend and told him that I stopped learning, so he encouraged me again, and I started to learn from zero .. I started to see Progress i was so happy i developed my first website the smile was touching my ears however i decided to improve myself more and more and I decided to buy courses form udemy my knowledge was so much improved So i saw that The failure is The mother of all success so iam still learning new stuff till now, never [e]ver give up and never stop learning‚ù§<a href="index.html">Home</a></p>
